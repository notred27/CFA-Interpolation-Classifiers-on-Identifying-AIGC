# CFA-Interpolation-Classifiers-on-Identifying-AIGC
Code repository that was used when creating the paper titled "Investigating the Effectiveness of Deep Learning and CFA Interpolation Based Classifiers on Identifying AIGC" by Micahel Reidy,
Henry Mallon, and Jiebo Luo. This repository contains classifers that are able to distinguish between AI-generated images (so called AIGC) and genuinely captured images by CFA percent error techniques.
$F^1$ is a 1-dimensional feature that is used in thresholding classifiers, while $F^2$ is a 3-dimensional feature to be used in neural network classifiers.
